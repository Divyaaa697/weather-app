# weather-app
Objective:

Create a web page that interacts with a weather API to fetch real-time weather data. This data will either be based on:
Userâ€™s current location (using geolocation features) or
A location manually entered by the user.


Key Functionalities:

Weather API integration:

Use an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherStack) to gather weather data.
The data retrieved would include current weather conditions, temperature, and possibly other relevant metrics like humidity, wind speed, etc.

User Interaction:

The app should have an option to detect the user's current location and show weather data based on it.
Additionally, allow users to input a location (city or coordinates) and display the weather for that specific place.

Display Output:

Show details such as current temperature, weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.), and other relevant weather information on the webpage.

Technologies to Use:
HTML/CSS for building the user interface.
JavaScript (or a front-end framework like React or Vue.js) for making API calls and handling user input.
Weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) to fetch live weather data.

This task focuses on implementing both geolocation-based weather fetching and user-input-based weather fetching, while providing a clear and user-friendly interface to display the information.
